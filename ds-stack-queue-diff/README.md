* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Stack and queue are both data structure types they are equal in interest and choosing one rather than other depends on our implementation case and need.
Stack : is to apply FIFO methodology "first in first out" on your adding and removing data from your intended storage.
Queue: is similar to Stack except that its apply LIFO methodology "last in last out" 

Stack usage example : implementing history mechanism for web browsers.
Queue usage example : implementing helpdesk like makerpass :)
